                            Patch #366 - 2021/02/10

     * correct   a  compiler-warning  fix  in  patch  #352  which  allowed
       sign-extension of coordinate values (report by "CismonX").
     * correct  upper-limit for selection buffer, accounting for combining
       characters (report/testcase by Tavis Ormandy).
     * with alwaysHighlight true, xterm does not properly track focus. The
       screen->select   FOCUS  flag  remains  always  on,  which  prevents
       bellIsUrgent  from  working, as the urgent WM_HINT flag is only set
       in  setXUrgency()  when  the  window  is  not  focused. Fix this by
       updating screen->select in unselectwindow() regardless of the value
       of always_highlight (patch by Jiri Bohac).
     * improve  fix  for  interaction between SRM and ENQ (report by Grant
       Taylor).
     * build-fix   for  --with-Xaw3dxft,  needed  when  --with-toolbar  is
       omitted (report by Jimmy Olgeni, Emanuel Haupt).
